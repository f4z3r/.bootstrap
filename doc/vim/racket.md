## Installation

Install `racket` or `racket-minimal` via `pacman`. `asdf` also provides a versioned `racket`
installation.

## Language Server

Install the racket language server using `raco`:

```bash
raco pkg install racket-langserver
```

`coc` should be already configured to use the language server properly.

# Bitwarden

## Installation

Install the unofficial rust CLI client from `community`: `rbw`.

## Usage

You can use `rbw ls` to list the entries, and `rbw get` to get entries.

Then use the configured script to copy the password from the CLI:

```sh
pass
```

> Note this requires `fzf` as a dependency.

# Notes

## Local and Private Notes

We use `vim-pad` for local notes on the laptop. These notes are stored in `~/.pad-notes/` and can be
invoked via multiple keyboard shortcuts. Moreover, it can create local notes into a local `.notes`
directory and even link then to files.

- `<leader>ns`, or `<leader>sn`: search notes,
- `<leader>nl`: list notes,
- `<leader>nn`: new note,
- `<leader>nf`: new note for current file.


## Shared Notes

For shared notes with mobile devices, we use SimpleNote. This provides an app, a webUI, and an
electron based desktop application.
